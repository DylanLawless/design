## Overview

The main website is a static Jekyll site styled for clarity, minimalism, and credibility.  
It introduces Switzerland Omics' products (e.g. **Quant**, **PanelAppRex AI**), outlines our approach to variant interpretation, and includes information about partnerships, research, and contact.

Some parts of the broader Switzerland Omics web stack use additional infrastructure including:

- 🔧 **Netlify functions** support on-demand content and integrations, including AI agents  
- 🧬 A separate authenticated platform (customer-facing) uses:
  - **Next.js 15 (Turbopack)**  
  - **Supabase** for auth, database, and storage  
  - **Stripe** for one-time payments  
  - **Drizzle ORM**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Radix UI**

These systems are not part of the main static site but are developed internally under `~/so`, alongside `~/so/web/switzerlandomics.ch`, on dedicated company infrastructure.

## Local development

To serve the static site locally:

```bash
sh jek.sh
sh kill_serve.sh
````

This will stop and start the testing env, equivalent to: 

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
````

Site runs at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
